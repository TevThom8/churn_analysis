### Overview

Hi there! Welcome to my Netflix Movie Recommendation System project. I built this system to suggest movies and TV shows you might enjoy based on your viewing history. By diving into a Netflix dataset, I explored various data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to create a personalized recommendation experience.


### Project Goals:<br>
<hr>

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing:<br>
Gather and clean the Netflix dataset to ensure it's ready for analysis.
Handle any missing data to keep things consistent and accurate.


#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>
Analyze the dataset to uncover interesting patterns and insights.
Create visualizations that highlight key trends and features.


##### Model Training:<br>
Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical format.
Apply cosine similarity to find relationships between different titles.
Recommendation System Development:
Build a recommendation system using those cosine similarity scores.
Develop a user-friendly class (FlixHub) to manage the recommendation process.


#### Evaluation and Testing:<br>
Test the system with different scenarios to ensure itâ€™s accurate and reliable.
Optimize the algorithm for the best performance possible.


### Outcomes
<hr>

#### Data Preprocessing:<br>
Successfully cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Performed thorough EDA to understand the data and uncover trends.


#### Model Implementation:<br>
Applied TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to build a solid recommendation system.
Efficiently managed data processing by saving and reloading matrices.
User-Friendly Recommendation System:
Developed the FlixHub class to easily generate movie and TV show recommendations.
Verified system performance with multiple test cases, ensuring accurate and relevant recommendations.


#### Visualization and Reporting:<br>
Created visualizations to illustrate data trends and model performance.
Documented the entire process with clear explanations and comments.
